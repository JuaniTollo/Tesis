<context>Jess said : I mean , feminism is supposed to be egalitarian , maybe we should n't be anointing great women for the rest of us to look up to , like they make history and we do n't - particularly if we 're trying to empower women , the concept of the hero is very disempowering , and - one of the only times I 'd use the word - quite patriarchal . "" I do agree with this , but perhaps there are ways to highlight the good things people have done without casting them as heros , per se . I am fully against the individualisation of historical change ( i.e. this person caused X to happen , rather than X happened , these people were there ) .</context>

I do n't really know what the mail in rebate is about - is it online anywhere for me to see the terms and conditions ?

<context>Last night I finished reading the book Brilliant Interview which showed I could have answered a couple of questions yesterday better . This morning I had an interview for a Telecoms company in Clapham . Now initially I was n't keen on the place because of the commute and half an hour longer working day . However the commute was n't as bad as I thought it 'd be , the area was nice and the building nice . The bloke who was interviewing me seemed very chilled and very friendly . We chatted a bit then he asked me some questions .</context>

<context>To my horror the doctor called me into a room to discuss my options that morning after looking at the scans I was scared , The scans showed a big fracture at the vertebrae at Level 4 which had broken into 3 pieces and was making things complicated . Mr Wilson explained to me that if I were to have a disc replacement at this level the chances of it holding up were slim , so he explained that fusing this level and the one below would be the best solution long term . This meant Double fusion at levels 4 & level 5 and after seeing the scans I was shocked . He explained this as a unique case that he had never seen before and that my back had taken a pounding and needed something to be done .</context>
